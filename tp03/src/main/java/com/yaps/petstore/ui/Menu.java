 * More sophisticated menus with embedded actions could be interesting.
 * 
 * <p> Remark : the way to pass the console is an interesting,
 * even if minor, design choice.
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> to keep it as an instance variable (our current choice) is
 *      practical, and allows testing ;
 * <li> pass it to individual methods has merit : the building of "Menu" would 
 *      be separated from its use, and the console is not logically part
 *      of the menu ;
 * <li> to fetch the console from System would be easy, but introduce
 *      a hidden dependency, which is bad in case of code modification.
